Material for MLOps Training

## Objective:

MLOps, relatively a new discipline, helps organizations and business leaders generate long-term value and
reduce risk associated with data science, machine learning, and AI initiatives. As per this report, more
than 80% of the ML or Data Science projects never make it to production because of several challenges in
identifying, designing, developing and operationalizing ML models. This course is designed to make
students aware of the challenges and equip them will tools, techniques and best practices to deal with
these challenges. Students will learn about the different layers of the data pipeline, approaches to model
selection, training, scaling, as well as how to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML systems.

The primary course objectives are as follows:

1. Understand key stages in ML development lifecycle and key components in ML Systems Design.
2. Learn how to identify and define ML problem scopes and create data management strategies.
3. Learn how to select models, debug models and keep track of various model experiments
4. Understand how to choose infrastructure and tools for data preparation, model building and
deployments.
5. Understand various model validation strategies and when to use what metrics for measuring
model accuracies.
6. Learn model deployment concepts like model compression, concept drift, monitoring and model
updates.
